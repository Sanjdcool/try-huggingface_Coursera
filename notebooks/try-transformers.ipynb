That was his goal. And it was a good moment because it reaffirmed the role this country has played for the last 20, 30 years, I think. So, it wasn't just a question of getting the president to do it â€” the President was able to put the country together that way.\\n\\nI will be very careful of what I'll say a long time from now, and I hope, just before we enter with our next President, he will talk to everybody in terms of how he feels about the world and what's right for him, what's wrong for him or what's wrong for his country and what's going on in the world. But I certainly have not said the president should go in the direction of doing what's best for us.\\n\\nAnd I do think it's important to understand the other, more important part of this. I can't say anything negative about it because the president spoke at length about that.\\n\\nBut that said: I think this situation is a real issue, and what I am trying to say is that there aren't issues that have the level of public support that we're getting and this has the potential to have a profound effect on other places around the world. But it's time to start the discussion about our leadership.\\n\\nAnd then the president was elected. He's very well placed to act, if President Obama and Congress don't work out what that says, as is the case for the first seven years of Mr Trump. So we can begin to get clear on what he means.\\n\\nGILLIAN LOUIS D'SZIELLARD: But I mean, look, there is always a moment when this president says he's going to step out of the Republican party and leave the Democratic party and walk away from the Republican party.\\n\\nI think it's important that he does the right thing for the United States.
